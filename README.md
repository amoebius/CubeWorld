"Project-Submission" Branch
---------------------------

This branch should be static - maintaining the source in the state which it was submitted as a major project, with essentially a quick game developed on top of an SVO-based terrain.

For a compiled version (building this was notorious due to linking with GLBasic...) see the 'Binaries' folder - complete with a simple installer to unpack everything for you :)  Well, if you're on windows that is.
(i.e. run https://github.com/amoebius/CubeWorld/raw/Project-Submission/Binaries/Install.exe to install - no registry entries, I promise!)

For a better overview of everything I want this project to become / use the framework for, see the master branch (https://github.com/amoebius/CubeWorld/tree/master).
